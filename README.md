# Simple Stardate Calendar for Fantasy Grounds

A very simple, kind of dumb calendar for doing very basic Star Trek-like
Stardates in Fantasy Grounds.

This takes a roughly TNG-like approach to Stardates with the suggestion
that are 1,000 days to a "Staryear". (For the most part during the
development of TNG, each season was given 1,000 days to spread its
episodes across and the preceding numbers represented the season of
filming.)

Because Fantasy Grounds expects months and weeks, we invent them as
kilostardays and decastardays, respectively.

Unfortunately FG doesn't seem to let us modify time formats, so we
probably can't accurately use "part of day" decimals.
